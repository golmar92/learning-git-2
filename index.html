			<h1 class="title">Aerosmith - Dream on</h1>
			<p class="verse1">
			Every time I look in the mirror 
			All these lines on my face getting clearer 
			The past is gone 
			It went by like dusk to dawn 
			Isn't that the way 
			Everybody's got their dues in life to pay 
			</p>
			<p class="verse2">
			Yeah, I know nobody knows 
			Where it comes and where it goes 
			I know it's everybody's sin 
			You got to lose to know how to win 
			</p>
