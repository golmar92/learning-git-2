			<p class="verse verse1">
			Every time I look in the mirror<br> 
			All these lines on my face getting clearer<br> 
			The past is gone<br>
			It went by like dusk to dawn<br> 
			Isn't that the way<br> 
			Everybody's got their dues in life to pay 
			</p>
			<p class="verse verse2">
			Yeah, I know nobody knows<br>
			Where it comes and where it goes<br>
			I know it's everybody's sin<br>
			You got to lose to know how to win
			</p>
			<p class="verse verse3">
			Half my life's in books' written pages<br> 
			Live and learn from fools and from sages<br>
			You know it's true<br>
			All the things come back to you
			</p>
